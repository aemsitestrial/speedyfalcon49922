# eds-ue-block-development

Create and evolve reusable blocks in Adobe EDS using boilerplate conventions.

## Use When

- Implementing or refactoring blocks under blocks/<block-name>/.
- Adding authorable structure with resilient DOM decoration.
- Improving responsive behavior and accessibility of blocks.

## Responsibilities

- Ensure each block remains self-contained:
  - blocks/<name>/<name>.js
  - blocks/<name>/<name>.css
  - blocks/<name>/_<name>.json
- Use robust DOM decoration patterns and tolerate missing authored fields.
- Keep CSS selectors block-scoped and mobile-first.
- Preserve progressive page loading behavior and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- Add concise comments only where logic is non-obvious.

## Quality Checklist

- Block renders correctly with partial or missing content.
- Accessibility checks pass for headings, links, and media.
- CSS stays scoped and does not leak outside the block.
- Linting passes for JavaScript and CSS.
